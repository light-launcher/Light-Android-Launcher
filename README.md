## Free yourself from huge streams of information

<p><b>Configurable, minimalistic, super lightweight app launcher with a low memory usage and small install size.</b></p>

### How to use
<p>Main screen allows you to add favourite apps.</p>
<p>To access all-apps view, just swipe top vertically from bottom of your screen. Long press on that view allows you to read info about app. To go back to favourites view press back button or swipe bottom vertically.</p>

### Free & Open Source
No trackers, no ads, and no device permissions. Open Source Code, available on GPLv2 license.

Fork of https://github.com/Collinux/minimalist-launcher.

### Android version
Works with each Android version from 2.0 (API 5).
   
### Contribution
Project was done for my personal usage, but I am aware that some people prefer simplicity and some need the small battery drain or processor usage - thats why I decided to share the project. Feel free to contribute.
