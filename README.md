Android version
===============
Works with each Android version from 2.0 (API 5)

### E-paper version
One of the goals of the app was to provide smooth experience for older e-paper devices like Nook Simple Touch (NST). Because of Android API changes I had to abandon this feature on this repo. **If you wish to get e-paper version** please go to [this](https://github.com/postapczuk/Light-ePaper-Launcher/releases) repo.

Free & Open Source

### Contribution
Project was done for my personal usage, but I am aware that some people prefer simplicity and some need low battery drain and processor usage - thats why I decided to share the project. Feel free to contribute.
